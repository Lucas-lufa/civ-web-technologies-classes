## Challenge one
Insert the <form> element below the existing content in the <main> section but inside the <div class="container">.
Add the following form fields inside the <form>:
- Name (text input)
- Email (email input)
- Message (textarea)
- Subject (select dropdown)
- Subscribe (checkbox)
Ensure each input field has a corresponding <label> element.
Use appropriate for attributes to associate labels with input fields.
Add a "Submit" button at the end of the form.
Implement basic validation for the email input field using the required and type="email" attributes.
Apply CSS styles to the form using the provided external CSS file ("styles.css").
Below the form, add a placeholder <div> to display a confirmation message when the form is successfully submitted. You can initially hide it with CSS.
## Challenge two Using the Math object
In your script.js file write some JS to
Create two variables, length and width, and assign them values representing the dimensions of a rectangle (e.g., length = 5, width = 8).
Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula: area = length * width.
Display the calculated area on the console.
Use the Math.round() method to round the area to the nearest integer before displaying it using console.log()
## Challenge three Using the Math object
In your script.js file write some JS to:
Generate 5 random numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
Calculate the sum of these 10 random numbers.
Calculate the average of these numbers.
Calculate the square root of the average.
Find the largest number among the generated random numbers.
Calculate the factorial of the largest number.
Display the generated numbers, sum, average, square root of the average, and factorial of the largest number using template literals.
